## How to reproduce results

1. Either open the php/html files.

or

2. Add the `.htaccess` file to a server (quicker method).

## `Sec-` prefix

Adding new request headers increases the risk that legacy server systems
already use those values for a different purpose. Changing the request header
values that such legacy systems receive may result in server bugs.

While that risk is significantly mitigated by the opt-in mechanisms of Client
Hints (as servers would be opting in to get Client Hints headers), we feel
it is required to mitigate it even further. So, Client Hints request headers
should be preceded by the `Sec-` prefix.

The `Sec-` prefix also ensures that these headers are only generated by the
browser and not added by potentially-malicious developers. That gives servers
further guarantees when processing those headers. It may also enable us to
simplify the related Fetch processing model, as it clearly indicates that these
are headers that were added by the user agent.
